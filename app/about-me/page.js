      <h1>About the Developer</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Tejas Kohli and I am the author of this site. I made it
        because it was a convergence between two major interests of mine:
        political science and computer science. At the time of writing this, I
        am a junior in Lambert High School in Georgia. Along with political and
        computer science, I enjoy reading, watching television and movies,
        playing Minecraft, singing, playing piano, and listening to music. I
        participate in choir in school, and I have gone to the All State Chorus
        four times as of writing. I also am a member of my school's academic bowl team.
