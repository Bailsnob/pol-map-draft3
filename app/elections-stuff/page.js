      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        This is just a place where I want to share some of my favorite
        presidential elections. I always find myself going back to read about
        them because they are so interesting and impactful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>1812:</h3>
      <p>
        I find this one interesting because it kind of bucks the trend that was
        started with the election of 1800. In discussions of the First Party
        System, most people seem to think that the federalists completely faded
        away after John Adams's loss in 1800. However, in this election, even
        though they didn't win, the federalists made up a lot of ground to
        become in contention for the presidency again. This comeback was also
        seen in the congressional elections of 1812. After the Hartford
        Convention, the Federalist Party collapsed, but I think this election
        serves as an important reminder that political fortunes can always
        change.

      <h3>1844:</h3>
      <p>
        This election is interesting because it shows the importance of
        consistent messaging towards winning elections. Oftentimes, the force
        with which a candidate expresses their views is more important to voters
        than the views they are expressing. 1844 offers a textbook example of
        this phenomenon. After John Tyler's moderate and independent presidency,
        Henry Clay and James K. Polk (the Whig and Democratic candidates,
        respectively) both cast themselves as constituting a full embrace of
        their respective parties' ideals. However, Clay was, like the party he
        represented, deeply conflicted over the annexation of Texas, which Tyler
        was actively pursuing. Clay made several attempts to explain his full
        thoughts on the issue, but Polk effectively cast Clay as "waffling"
        while he spoke consistently in favor of annexation. In the end, Clay's
        indecisiveness is seen as a major factor in his narrow loss that year.

      <h3>1896:</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone knows that this election was a big deal; it initiated the
        Fourth Party System after all. The thing I find most interesting about
        1896 is that it may be the purest manifestation of class conflict in the
        United States. The entire nascent progressive movement put its weight
        behind the star from Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan, while the entire
        business sector put its weight behind William McKinley. In the end,
        McKinley won, but I would argue that the unification of the left that
        Bryan encapsulated would set the stage for the end of the Gilded Era and
        the liberalism of the Progressive Era and New Deal.

      <h3>1912:</h3>
      <p>
        This election is, rightfully, seen as one of the most interesting in
        American History. Four candidates won above 5% of the vote, and three
        even won electoral college votes. However, what I find interesting about
        this election is that, despite the wide array of choices voters had
        before them, ideologically, they were all very similar. Wilson,
        Roosevelt, and Taft (the Democratic, Republican, and Progressive
        candidates, respectively) all styled themselves as progressives, and
        their disagreements were mainly over the effectiveness of proposed
        reforms, not the ideas behind them. Even Debs, the Socialist candidate
        viewed Roosevelt as stealing his populist rhetoric to trick voters into
        reforming, rather than destroying, the Capitalist system. The main
        takeaway from this similarity is that successful parties know which way
        the wind blows: they must mold their initiatives and rhetoric to match
        the popular views of the time, else they die. Such was the fate of
        Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party.

      <h3>1968:</h3>
      <p>
        This election is most remembered for its turbulent campaign, and it was,
        indeed, a gripping one. With political assassinations, fervant protests,
        rising crime, and just an overall atmosphere of bitterness and
        skepticism, its discord represented the apotheosis of the turbulence of
        the 60s. However, the aspect of this election that I find most
        intersting is Hubert Humphrey's poltical comeback. On paper, reading
        through the environment going into the election, it seems like he was
        dealt an unwinnable hand. An unpopular president, racial discontent, a
        civil war in his own party -- Humphrey was never going to win. However,
        by turning out his core base of laborers and minorities, he brought the
        party within 3 states of winning.
